# Obsidian

Obsidian is the latest in a long line of game engine projects of mine.
I have been fascinated by game engines for years, and deeply curious as to how they work.
One day, I decided that the best way to learn how these massive projects work is to make one of my own.
I've had many projects over the past few years with varying degrees of success, and I've learned a lot along the way.

This particular project is taken from [Travis Vroman's Kohi series](https://kohiengine.com/), which strives to create a fully-featured game engine with C and Vulkan from the ground up.
I will be mostly following along with the YouTube series, while also making my own style adjustments along the way to better fit the way I program.
